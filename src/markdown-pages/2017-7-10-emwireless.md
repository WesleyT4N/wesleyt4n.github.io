A simple static site built and deployed as a freelance project for a Rhode
Island-based phone vendor. View [here](http://em-wireless.com/)

# languages and technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# background
This was a simple site I built as a freelancer to help a phone vendor get some
online presence. Includes a summary of their services and a contact form to help
customers reach out to the store.

# my role

## front-end

- Designed layout using wireframes
- Used PHP to help with some basic templating
- Ensured site was mobile responsive so customers using their phones could navigate
the site easily

## back-end

- Correctly validated and handled contact form responses so they could be filtered
and then sent to the company email

## misc

- Implemented some basic SEO
- Handled the entire deployment process (registration of domain, finding shared
hosting provider, etc.)
